# Day #27

1. Apply KNN for titanic dataset for k values, k=1 to k=267 ( Taking dependent variable constant as Pclass , you have to use loop)

2. Apply SVM for titanic dataset with each DV=Pclass,Survived,Gender,Embarked,SibSp,Parch, separately .

    And calculate Accuracy amd confusion matrix for both knn and Svm .

    In Knn , Plot the graph for k value at one axis , and accuracy on another . And find the best k value which gives high accuracy .
