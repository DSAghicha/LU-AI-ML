## Tasks

- **Question 1:**

    Assuming that we have some email addresses in the *"username@companyname.com"* format, please write program to print the company name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.

    ```text
    Input Format:
        The first line of the input contains an email address.
    Output Format:
        Print the company name in single line.

    Example:

            john@google.com
        Output:
            google
    ```

- **Question 2:**

    Write a program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma separated sequence after sorting them  alphabetically.

    ```text
    Input Format:
        The first line of input contains words separated by the comma.
    Output Format:
        Print the sorted words separated by the comma.
    Example:
        Input:
            without,hello,bag,world

- **Question 4:**

   Given a list of n-1 numbers ranging from 1 to n, your task  is to find the missing number. There are no duplicates.

   ```text
    Input Format:
        The first line contains n-1 numbers with each number separated by a space.
    Output Format:
        Print the missing number
    Example:
        Input: 1 2 4 6 3 7 8
        Output: 5
    
    Explanation:
        In the above list of numbers 5 is missing and hence 5 is the input
   ```

- **Question 5:**

    With a given list L, write a program to print this list L after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.

    ```text
    If the input list is 12 24 35 24 88 120 155 88 120 155
    Then the output should be 12 24 35 88 120 155
    
    Explanation:
        Third, seventh and ninth element of the list L has been removed because it was already present.
    ```

    ```text
    Input Format:
        In one line take the elements of the list L with each element separated by a space.
    Output Format:
        Print the elements of the modified list in one line with each element separated by a space.
    Example:
        Input: 12 24 35 24
        Output: 12 24 35
    ```
